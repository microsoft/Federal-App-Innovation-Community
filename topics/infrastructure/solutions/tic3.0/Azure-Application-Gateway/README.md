# TIC 3.0 Compliant App Service using Azure Application Gateway
## Problem Statement

Federal organizations and government agencies are the most likely implementers of TIC 3.0 compliance solutions for their Azure-based web applications and API services. Version 3.0 of the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) migrates TIC from on-premises data collection to a cloud-based approach that better supports modern cloud-based applications and services. TIC 3.0 telemetry collection is driven by a firewall. 

There are two types of firewalls in Azure; native Azure Firewall, layer 4, and Web Application Firewall, layer 7. Azure Application Gateway is a regional load balancer with support for a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Azure Application Gateway with WAF is a great solution for single-region applications and services. The Web Application Firewall will secure the application with built-in rules, custom rules, geo-filtering, and more. 

## Demo Solution

The following solution is a one-click, out-of-the-box deployment. All services needed to deploy, secure, and monitor a TIC 3.0 application with an Azure Application Gateway are included. The deploy application service is running the default template to showcase its external accessibility and security. You can replace the default app service solution with your own custom application for a quick, TIC 3.0 compliance web application to your users and agency. 

###### TIC 3.0 Compliant App Service Architecture using Azure Application Gateway

![Architecture](../images/Arch-AzureAppGateway.png)

### Requirements
The following must be performed before using this deployment scenario:
- None, solution will deploy as an isolated resource from existing Azure resources.

### Deploys and Updates
Deploy Virtual Network, App Service, AppGateway Subnet with Microsoft.Web service endpoint, App Gateway, Log Analytics workspace, Automation Account, Assign Automation Account's Managed Identity with Log Analytics Reader role to Log Analytics workspace, and Alert. The deployed App Service will become the backend to the App Gateway and restricted to only accept request from the App Gateway IP. This configures the app so it is only accessible using App Gateway public IP.

This deployment scenario will deploy and update the following:

- Deploy Virtual Network with subnet for application and an Application Gateway
- Deploy subnet for Application Gateway
- Deploy Application Gateway
- Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF) policy
- Associate WAF with Application Gateway
- Deploy App service with default template
- Configure App service with restricted access for the application gateway's subnet
- Configure Application Gateway to route traffic to the application so that users must use the Application Gateway public IP to connect to the application. 
-- Custom FQDN must be manually configured and associated with the Application Gateway, post deployment.
- Deploy Log Analytics workspace
- Configure Application Gateways Diagnostic Settings to send logs and metrics to Log Analytics workspace
- Deploy Automation Account
- Assign Automation Account's Managed Identity with Log Analytics Reader role to Log Analytics workspace
- Deploy Alert

## Deployment Methods
### Azure Portal
Use the following button to deploy to Azure Commercial or Azure Government using the Azure Portal.

| [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FFederal-App-Innovation-Community%2Fmain%2Ftopics%2Finfrastructure%2Fsolutions%2Ftic3.0%2FAzure-Application-Gateway%2Fazuredeploy.json) | [![Deploy to Azure Government](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paullizer/Federal-App-Innovation-Community-1/main/topics/infrastructure/solutions/tic3.0/images/deploytoazuregov.png)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FFederal-App-Innovation-Community%2Fmain%2Ftopics%2Finfrastructure%2Fsolutions%2Ftic3.0%2FAzure-Application-Gateway%2Fazuredeploy.json) |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |

### Azure PowerShell
The following PowerShell code can be executed from the Azure Cloud Shell or locally if you have [installed Az Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-7.3.2). 

You must update the *SubscriptionName* with your Azure Subscription that you want to deploy the solution

```powershell
$jsonUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Federal-App-Innovation-Community/main/solutions/infrastructure/tic3.0/Azure-Application-Gateway/azuredeploy.json"`
$location = "East US"`
$resourceGroupName = "RG-Example-Tic3_0-AppGateway"`
$suffix = Get-Random -Maximum 1000`

Connect-AzAccount`
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName "SubscriptionName"`
New-AzResourceGroup -Name ($resourceGroupName+"-"+$suffix) -Location $location` 
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName ($resourceGroupName+"-"+$suffix) -TemplateUri $jsonUrl`
```

## Post Deployment Tasks
To finalize TIC 3.0 compliance the following tasks must be completed to actually deliver your logs to the CISA CLAW.
- Coordinate with your CISA POC to receive your 
  - CLAW S3 Access Key (aka Id)
  - CLAW S3 Access Secret
  - CLAW S3 Bucket Name
  
### Update Automation account variables
The ARM template created variables that are used by the runbook to access the Log Analytics workspace using the application's service principle. Some variables will need to be updated over time. The CLAW secrets will expire. It is important to coordinate receipt of a new CLAW secret before it expires.

The variables are encrypted. This means that you or anyone cannot view them from portal or consoles. They can only be decrypted from within a runbook. When you update a variable because a secret is expiring or you want to use a different Log Analytics workspace, you just edit the value which overwrite the existing when you save it.

This example walks through updating the **AWSAccessKey**, repeat the steps for each Variable. 

![Edit Variable](../images/UpdateAutoAcctVar-Edit.png)

![Save Variable](../images/UpdateAutoAcctVar-Save.png)

1. Go to the Automation account created during deployment
2. Select **Variables** from the left hand menu, you will have to scroll down to view it
3. Select **AWSAccessKey**,
   1. You will start with this variable but you must update each variable
4. Select **Edit value**
5. Enter the AWS Access Key provided to you by CISA
6. Select **Save**

Repeat for **AWSSecretKey** and **S3BucketName**

## Ready for uploading logs to CLAW
Logs from your deployed scenario will be uploaded to the CLAW starting 1 hour after the deployed scenario and then every 15 minutes.
