# Federal Application Innovation Community Repository

This repository was created to demonstrate patterns, solutions, and demos for federal customers and partners. This guidiance is built by an active open-source community with an authentic federal perspective. Teams can use this repo as a starting point to successfully implement cloud-native architectures and services in Azure Cloud & Azure Government Cloud.

The goal is to address high-value problems, unique scenarios, while providing actionable gudiance and direction. You should refer to these solutions as a starting point to accerlerate you cloud adoption journey. Feel free to fork a copy of this repo for your own use cases, requirements, experimentation, learning and cloud adoption journey.

### Automation & Testing

The contribution should have a clear approach for how to work through your solution & training resource. Ideally for solutions, we are looking for automated approaches using Infrastructure-as-Code (ideally Bicep or Terraform). However, we will welcome any form of automation including scripts since we want solutions to be added sooner rather than later and we can iterate from there.

Additionally, we have a focus on testing solutions both in [Azure Cloud and Azure Government](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-government/compare-azure-government-global-azure).

As part of the peer review process, we will attempt the test your solution so that we can validate the automation and also try to validate that the solution deploys across both clouds and addresses unique needs in either one (for example, [endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-government/compare-azure-government-global-azure#guidance-for-developers) may differ across the two clouds which should be addressed in your solution).

### Folder Naming Conventions

Follow the folder convention below to add your contribution. Generally we will look for automated solutions using Bicep, but within your particular solution feel free to leverage a different approach for automation like Terraform or even scripts with the `az cli`. We will be flexible with the folder structure within your solution as long as a `README.md` is provided for guidance on how it works.

Apply your opinion on what topic area your content should be included under (and if maybe a new topic is required, feel free to suggest that), we can then review on the PR should there be any other thoughts.
