# Federal Application Innovation Solutions Repository

This repository was created to demonstrate patterns, solutions, and demos that teams can use as starting points to successfully implement cloud-native architectures and services in Azure Cloud and Azure Government Cloud.

The goal is to address high-value problems, unique scenarios, and provide direction. You should refer to these solutions as starting points that you can then customize, fork, etc. for your own use cases and requirements.
